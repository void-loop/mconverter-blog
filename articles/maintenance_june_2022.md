We are in the process of making some server upgrades, which will make the service much faster. To complete the upgrades, we need to temporarily take the server offline. At maximum, this will take half an hour. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

After the upgrades are complete, you can expect up to **70% faster file uploads**, depending on your internet connection.
